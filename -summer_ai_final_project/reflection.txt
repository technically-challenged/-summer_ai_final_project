                                    Reflection for minimax code
    
    The problem I was trying to solve was using a minimax algorithm to win a game of tic tac toe. 
I did this by using pseudo code from a provided book chapter and with the help of the TAs. 

    One of the most major choices that I made was splitting the minimax algorithm into 3 different 
functions; a main minimax function, a max_value function, and a min_value function. I did this 
because the book chapter split the algorithm up the same way, and I aimed to translate the given 
pseudo code as closely as possible so as to not confuse myself during the process.  

    The system that I implemented works very well. Each time I have played the algorithm it has either 
won or tied. When I ran the minimax against itself, it would play the same moves every time I re-ran 
the code, which demonstrates that its calculations are consistent. 	 

    Given the fact that I learned all of the knowledge I have of python in the past 3 weeks, I think 
the method I chose of relying very heavily on the pseudo code was very appropriate given the task. If 
I were to do a similar project in the future I would aim to write my own pseudo code that I understand 
more in depth so the transition to python is smoother. If I had more time I would have liked to try 
alpha-beta pruning, and be able to compare that to the minimax algorithm that I have now. To my 
knowledge, there are no ethical implications of any variety in my code.
